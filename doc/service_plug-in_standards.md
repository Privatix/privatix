# Service plug-in standards

## Requirements

- At minimum service plug-in must contain offering and access template with unique hash
- Usage should be reported using `Adapter API`

# Installation by dapp-installer

To make offering template be imported by `dapp-installer`, folder and file naming should comply with `service plug-in naming conventions`.

# Service plug-in naming conventions

## Product id

Each service plug-in should have unique `product id` (uuid v4). We expect in future to create mapping between service plug-in maintainer ethereum address and unique product id. This will give ability for a maintainer to reserve `product id` for his service plug-in and sign his service plug-in. User/software will have ability to:

- verify that service plug-in is maintained by somebody that user trusts
- prevent from scammers to have same products (`product id's`) as trusted maintainer
- allow service plug-in signature verification and belonging to trusted maintainer

Example of `product id`: `73e17130-2a1d-4f7d-97a8-93a9aaa6f10d`

## Folder structure

-:open_file_folder: core folder

--:open_file_folder: product

---:open_file_folder: \<product id\>

----:open_file_folder: bin

----:open_file_folder: config

----:open_file_folder: data

----:open_file_folder: log

----:open_file_folder: template

---:open_file_folder: \<product id\>

----:open_file_folder: bin

----:open_file_folder: config

----:open_file_folder: data

----:open_file_folder: log

----:open_file_folder: template

### Folder conventions

`bin` - contains all binary/executable/scripts. Can contain subfolders. Can contain 3rd party software in subfolders. During upgrade, it should be replaced by newer versions.

`config` - adapter config and preferably all other config files. During upgrade, it should be left with or without changes of config files.

`data` - folder to store any data. It remains during upgrade.

`log` - log of adapter. Preferably any other logs goes here.

`template` - offering, access, product template stored here and imported during install of service plug-in.

#### Templates

Templates are located in `template` folder. Following naming and folder structure must be maintained:

----:open_file_folder: template

-----:open_file_folder: products

------:page_facing_up: `client.json`

------:page_facing_up: `server.json`

-----:open_file_folder: templates

------:page_facing_up: `access.json`

------:page_facing_up: `offering.json`

-----:page_facing_up: `adapter.agent.config.json`

-----:page_facing_up: `adapter.client.config.json`

`client.json` - client product object that imported to Privatix Core DB to products table. Represents client service plug-in initial configuration/settings.

`server.json` - server product object that imported to Privatix Core DB to products table. Represents server service plug-in initial configuration/settings.

`access.json` - access message template (see [Access](access.md) for more)

`offering.json` - offering message template (see [Offerings](offering.md) for more)

`adapter.agent.config.json` - service plug-in adapter configuration file for Agent. It is template only for customization during installation. Resulting config file should reside in `config` folder.

`adapter.client.config.json` - service plug-in adapter configuration file for Client. It is template only for customization during installation. Resulting config file should reside in `config` folder.

# Dapp-installer

dapp-installer can install, update, remove service plug-in which is compliant with conventions listed above.

Given `install.agent.config.json` or `install.client.config.json` found in `config` folder by dapp-installer, they would be executed sequentially as part of install, update or remove workflow.

<details><summary>dapp-installer compatible config</summary>

```JSON
{
    "CoreDapp": false,
    "Install": [
        {"Admin" : true,"Command": "bin/inst install --config ../config/installer.agent.config.json"}
    ],
    "Remove": [
        {"Admin" : true,"Command": "bin/inst remove"}
    ],
    "Update": [
        {"Admin" : true,"Command": "bin/inst update"}
    ]
}
```

</details>

For each workflow dapp-installer will execute commands listed in `install.agent.config.json` or `install.client.config.json` files sequentially.

## Update

Before update, service plug-in folder is backed up. It is removed, only, if no errors occurred during installation. On errors, old folder is returned back.
