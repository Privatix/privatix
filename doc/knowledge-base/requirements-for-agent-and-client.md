## Starting the installation process <a id="id-1.Installtheapplication-Startingtheinstallationprocess"></a>

1. Download the appropriate version that depends on your OS from: [https://github.com/Privatix/privatix/releases](https://github.com/Privatix/privatix/releases**]%28https://github.com/Privatix/privatix/releases)
2. Install the application

## Role

You can install the application as:

* Client \(consumer\)
* Agent \(provider\)

During the installation process, you can choose a role that you wish to set. You cannot change role afterwards.

## Is there a minimum required upload speed/latency for running a node?

Any computer can likely handle the node running if it has a decent and reliable Internet connection.

The core software is not even theoretically capable of ensuring quality of service \(QoS\) in a decentralized P2P network.

The way to tackle QoS issues in Core is only through the Rating system. In case the quality of service will be low \( latency, speed, availability, etc.\) - it will affect the Rating
