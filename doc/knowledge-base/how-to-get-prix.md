# How to get PRIX

**PRIX**, an ERC20 token on the Ethereum Blockchain, is internal crypto-currency to exchange value \(utility\) between Privatix Network participants. 

To provide or consume services on Privatix Network, you must first transfer some PRIX tokens to your Privatix Network account.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, you should also load some **ETH** \(Ethereum\) tokens to your account balance, because when you do anything on the Ethereum blockchain, you must pay for that computation. That payment is calculated in gas, and gas is always paid in ETH.
{% endhint %}

On the final step of software installation, wizard will give you the address of your Privatix account and guide you how to fund your balance with PRIX and ETH .
