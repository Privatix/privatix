### Funds management 

The most important is to understand that no one will be able to restore your passwords or private keys if you lost it. 

When you install the PNCS, you will start with wizard which will guide you step-by-step. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please do not forget to write down your password and keep the backup of your private key in a safe place.
{% endhint %}

The PNCS ****account is represented by your ETH public key. Your private key is encrypted and used only by the software to operate within the network.

The Agents and Clients should have PRIX to execute any bandwidth deals and certain amount of ETH to cover transaction costs \(GAS\). 

There are 3 places where your funds \(PRIX and ETH\) can be located.

### 1\) Account 

The Account is yours ETH address with backup you made during the software installation. The backup is always available for download \(but not the password\).

> #### I have used your service as a Client and donâ€™t want to use it anymore, what should I do to withdraw all the rest funds ?

1. Terminate all the contracts you have. 
2. Wait 24 hours.
3. Transfer PRIX from Market to Account. 
4. Use the private keystore file \(backup\) and password to further operation with PRIX tokens or ETH. Further operations can be performed with any wallets that support import keystore files \(e.g. Metamask\).
