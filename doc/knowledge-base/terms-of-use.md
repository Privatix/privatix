                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 3, 29 June 2007
```

Copyright \(C\) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. [http://fsf.org/](http://fsf.org/) Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

```text
                        Preamble
```

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software \(and charge for them if you wish\), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: \(1\) assert copyright on the software, and \(2\) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS
```

1. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution \(with or without modification\), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that \(1\) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and \(2\) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work \(except to the extent that warranties are provided\), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

2. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that \(a\) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and \(b\) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component \(kernel, window system, and so on\) of the specific operating system \(if any\) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and \(for an executable work\) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

3. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

4. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

5. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

6. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a\) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

   b\) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

   c\) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

   d\) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

7. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

   a\) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product \(including a physical distribution medium\), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

   b\) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product \(including a physical distribution medium\), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either \(1\) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or \(2\) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

   c\) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

   d\) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place \(gratis or for a charge\), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server \(operated by you or a third party\) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

   e\) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either \(1\) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or \(2\) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term \(regardless of how the transaction is characterized\), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product \(for example, the work has been installed in ROM\).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented \(and with an implementation available to the public in source code form\), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

8. Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. \(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.\) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may \(if authorized by the copyright holders of that material\) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

   a\) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

   b\) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

   c\) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

   d\) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

   e\) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

   f\) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material \(or modified versions of it\) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

9. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License \(including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11\).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated \(a\) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and \(b\) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License \(for any work\) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

10. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

11. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation \(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit\) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

12. Patents.

    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent \(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement\). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either \(1\) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or \(2\) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or \(3\) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license \(a\) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you \(or copies made from those copies\), or \(b\) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

13. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

    If conditions are imposed on you \(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise\) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

14. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

15. Revised Versions of this License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

16. Disclaimer of Warranty.

    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

17. Limitation of Liability.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM \(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS\), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

18. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

               END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    ```

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright \(C\)  

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or \(at your option\) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

```text
<program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
```

The hypothetical commands `show w' and`show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer \(if you work as a programmer\) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

================================================================================ OpenVPN License OpenVPN Access Server End User License Agreement \(OpenVPN-AS EULA\)

Copyright Notice: OpenVPN Access Server License; Copyright \(c\) 2009-2018 OpenVPN Inc.. All rights reserved. “OpenVPN” is a trademark of OpenVPN Inc. Redistribution of OpenVPN Access Server binary forms and related documents, are permitted provided that redistributions of OpenVPN Access Server binary forms and related documents reproduce the above copyright notice as well as a complete copy of this EULA. You agree not to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, make any attempt to discover the source code of this software, or create derivative works from this software. The OpenVPN Access Server is bundled with other open source software components, some of which fall under different licenses. By using OpenVPN or any of the bundled components, you agree to be bound by the conditions of the license for each respective component. A copy of the EULA is also distributed with the Access Server in the file /usr/local/openvpn\_as/license.txt. This software is provided “as is” and any expressed or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed. In no event shall OpenVPN Inc. be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages \(including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption\) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort \(including negligence or otherwise\) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage. OpenVPN Inc. is the sole distributor of OpenVPN Access Server licenses. This agreement and licenses granted by it may not be assigned, sublicensed, or otherwise transferred by licensee without prior written consent of OpenVPN Inc. Any licenses violating this provision will be subject to revocation and deactivation, and will not be eligible for refunds. A purchased license entitles you to use this software for the duration of time denoted on your license key on any one \(1\) particular device, up to the concurrent user limit specified by your license. Multiple license keys may be activated to achieve a desired concurrency limit on this given device. Unless otherwise prearranged with OpenVPN Inc., concurrency counts on license keys are not to be divided for use amongst multiple devices. Upon activation of the first purchased license key in this software, you agree to forego any free licenses or keys that were given to you for demonstration purposes, and as such, the free licenses will not appear after the activation of a purchased key. You are responsible for the timely activation of these licenses on your desired server of choice. Refunds on purchased license keys are only possible within 30 days of purchase of license key, and then only if the license key has not already been activated on a system. To request a refund, contact us through our support ticket system using the account you have used to purchase the license key. Exceptions to this policy may be given for machines under failover mode, and when the feature is used as directed in the OpenVPN Access Server user manual. In these circumstances, a user is granted one \(1\) license key \(per original license key\) for use solely on failover purposes free of charge. Other failover and/or load balancing use cases will not be eligible for this exception, and a separate license key would have to be acquired to satisfy the licensing requirements. To request a license exception, please file a support ticket in the OpenVPN Access Server ticketing system. A staff member will be responsible for determining exception eligibility, and we reserve the right to decline any requests not meeting our eligibility criteria, or requests which we believe may be fraudulent in nature. Activating a license key ties it to the specific hardware/software combination that it was activated on, and activated license keys are nontransferable. Substantial software and/or hardware changes may invalidate an activated license. In case of substantial software and/or hardware changes, caused by for example, but not limited to failure and subsequent repair or alterations of \(virtualized\) hardware/software, our software product will automatically attempt to contact our online licensing systems to renegotiate the licensing state. On any given license key, you are limited to three \(3\) automatic renegotiations within the license key lifetime. After these renegotiations are exhausted, the license key is considered invalid, and the activation state will be locked to the last valid system configuration it was activated on. OpenVPN Inc. reserves the right to grant exceptions to this policy for license holders under extenuating circumstances, and such exceptions can be requested through a ticket via the OpenVPN Access Server ticketing system. Once an activated license key expires or becomes invalid, the concurrency limit on our software product will decrease by the amount of concurrent connections previously granted by the license key. If all of your purchased license key\(s\) have expired, the product will revert to demonstration mode, which allows a maximum of two \(2\) concurrent users to be connected to your server. Prior to your license expiration date\(s\), OpenVPN Inc. will attempt to remind you to renew your license\(s\) by sending periodic email messages to the licensee email address on record. You are solely responsible for the timely renewal of your license key\(s\) prior to their expiration if continued operation is expected after the license expiration date\(s\). OpenVPN Inc. will not be responsible for any misdirected and/or undeliverable email messages, nor does it have an obligation to contact you regarding your expiring license keys. Any valid license key holder is entitled to use our ticketing system for support questions or issues specifically related to the OpenVPN Access Server product. To file a ticket, go to our website at [http://openvpn.net/](http://openvpn.net/) and sign in using the account that was registered and used to purchase the license key\(s\). You can then access the support ticket system through our website and submit a support ticket. Tickets filed in the ticketing system are answered on a best-effort basis. OpenVPN Inc. staff reserve the right to limit responses to users of our demo / expired licenses, as well as requests that substantively deviate from the OpenVPN Access Server product line. Tickets related to the open source version of OpenVPN will not be handled here. Purchasing a license key does not entitle you to any special rights or privileges, except the ones explicitly outlined in this user agreement. Unless otherwise arranged prior to your purchase with OpenVPN Inc., software maintenance costs and terms are subject to change after your initial purchase without notice. In case of price decreases or special promotions, OpenVPN Inc. will not retrospectively apply credits or price adjustments toward any licenses that have already been issued. Furthermore, no discounts will be given for license maintenance renewals unless this is specified in your contract with OpenVPN Inc.

SQLite Copyright

—————-

SQLite is in the Public Domain.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite – those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Portions of the documentation and some code used as part of the build process might fall under other licenses. The details here are unclear. We do not worry about the licensing of the documentation and build code so much because none of these things are part of the core deliverable SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright \(C\) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software–to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. \(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.\) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software \(and charge for this service if you wish\), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps:

\(1\) copyright the software, and

\(2\) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors’ reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The “Program”, below, refers to any such program or work, and a “work based on the Program” means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. \(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.\) Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program \(independent of having been made by running the Program\). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

1. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a\) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. b\) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c\) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty \(or else, saying that you provide a warranty\) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. \(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.\)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program \(or with a work based on the Program\) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

1. You may copy and distribute the Program \(or a work based on it, under Section 2\) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

   a\) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

   b\) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

   c\) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. \(This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.\)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed \(in either source or binary form\) with the major components \(compiler, kernel, and so on\) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

1. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

1. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program \(or any work based on the Program\), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
2. Each time you redistribute the Program \(or any work based on the Program\), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein.

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

1. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason \(not limited to patent issues\), conditions are imposed on you \(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise\) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

1. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
2. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

1. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

1. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
2. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM \(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS\), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

Copyright \(C\)  

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as published by the Free Software Foundation.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright \(C\) year name of author

Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \`show w’.

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type \`show c’ for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w’ and`show c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w’ and`show c’; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items–whatever suits your program. You should also get your employer \(if you work as a programmer\) or your school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program \`Gnomovision’ \(which makes passes at compilers\) written by James Hacker.

, 1 April 1989

Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS.

2.1 InstallBuilder Software. Subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA, and subject to any applicable restrictions set forth on the Order Form, BitRock hereby grants to Licensee a perpetual, nonexclusive, nonsublicensable, nontransferable \(except in accordance with Section 14\) license to: \(A\) reproduce the Software solely for the purpose of installing the Software at the Location\(s\); \(B\) use the Software solely at the Location\(s\) and solely for Licensee's internal operation and use; \(C\) permit the number of Users specified on the Order Form or the Purchase Order, as the case may be, to install and use the Software to develop and manage applications that use the Software; and \(D\) deploy and use the applications pursuant to this Section 2. Licensee may make one backup copy of the Software per Location, for archival or disaster recovery purposes. The license granted herein is granted solely to the individual or entity set forth on the Order Form, and not, by implication or otherwise, to any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of such individual or entity. All rights not expressly granted hereunder are reserved to BitRock. Licensee may not copy, distribute, reproduce, use or allow access to the Software except as explicitly permitted under this Agreement. Licensee shall not modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works from, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Software or any internal data files generated by the Software, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. Licensee shall not use the Software in a service bureau modality, or lease, rent or loan the Software or the use thereof to any third party. Licensee shall not remove, obscure, or alter BitRock's or its licensors copyright notices, trademarks, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or contained within the Software. As between the parties, BitRock owns and shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including all copyrights, patents, trade secret rights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights therein. Licensee shall provide BitRock with access to Licensee's Location\(s\), at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, to verify Licensee's compliance with the terms of this EULA. The Software is licensed and not sold. Without limiting the foregoing, any terms and conditions on any Purchase Orders or similar materials submitted by Licensee to BitRock which are inconsistent with any of these terms and conditions shall be of no force or effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the automatic update tool that is included with all InstallBuilder Software downloads is considered a generated Installer Package for the purposes of this Agreement.

7.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF BITROCK OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS ARISING OUT OF THIS EULA WITH RESPECT TO ANY PARTICULAR SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF SUCH SOFTWARE EXCEED THE SUM OF THE LICENSE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE HEREUNDER FOR SUCH SOFTWARE.

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 7 REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.

1. CONFIDENTIALITY. The term "Confidential Information" shall mean any information disclosed by either party \(the "Disclosing Party"\) to the other party \(the "Receiving Party"\) in connection with this EULA which is disclosed in writing, orally or by inspection and is identified as "Confidential" or "Proprietary."

The Receiving Party shall treat as confidential all Confidential Information received from the Disclosing Party, shall not use such Confidential Information except as expressly permitted under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written consent. The Receiving Party shall use the same degree of care to protect the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party against unauthorized use or disclosure that it takes with its own confidential information of like nature, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. Notwithstanding the above, the restrictions of this Section shall not apply to information that: \(a\) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; \(b\) becomes known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, from a third party without breach of this Agreement and who had a right to disclose it; \(c\) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or becomes in the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; or \(d\) was rightfully known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, at the time of disclosure. Without terminating any restrictions or obligations of this Section, a Receiving Party is not prohibited hereunder from disclosing Confidential Information of the other party if such information is disclosed pursuant to the valid order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the disclosure is strictly limited to the extent necessary to comply with such order and, provided further that, the Receiving Party shall provide prompt notice thereof to the Disclosing Party and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a protective order or otherwise prevent public disclosure of such information.
2. TERMINATION. BitRock may terminate this EULA upon Licensee's breach of this EULA if Licensee fails to cure such breach within 15 days of receipt of BitRock's notice thereof. Upon termination or expiration of this EULA: \(a\) any fees owed to BitRock under this EULA before such termination or expiration will be immediately due and payable; \(b\) all licenses granted to Licensee in this EULA will immediately cease; and \(c\) Licensee must promptly discontinue all use of the Software, uninstall and erase all copies of the Software from Licensee's computers, and return or, at the option of BitRock, destroy all copies of the Software in Licensee's possession or control. Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 will survive termination or expiration of this EULA for any reason. Licenses to installation packages generated by Licensee and distributed by Licensee prior to termination of this EULA shall survive termination.
3. SUPPORT. Basic support is included in the Software License Fees. Subject to Customer's payment of the Software License Fees due for the Initial Period and any Renewal Period, BitRock will provide Customer with basic support for the InstallBuilder Software during the Initial Period and each such Renewal Period.

No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this EULA shall be effective unless in writing and signed by an officer of BitRock and an authorized representative of Licensee. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this EULA, except as specifically provided herein, shall operate as a waiver of any such right, power or remedy. Without limiting the foregoing, terms and conditions on any purchase orders or similar materials submitted by Licensee to BitRock shall be of no force or effect. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations of Customer under this Agreement may be assigned by Licensee in whole or in part without the prior written consent of BitRock \(except in connection with a merger or acquisition, or the sale of all or substantially all of such party's assets\), and any attempted assignment or transfer by Licensee in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. This Agreement, is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties and supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or written, and any other communications between the parties in relation to the subject matter of this Agreement.
