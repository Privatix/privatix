# How to buy VPN service

To start using VPN services, you should install [Pivatix Core software](https://privatix.io/#download) in Client mode. Follow the wizard's instructions to create account and [load your balance with PRIX /ETH tokens](https://docs.privatix.network/knowledge-base/how-to-get-prix) in order to pay for the services across Privatix Network.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note, when you accept VPN offering, the selected amount of PRIX tokens from Marketplace balance will be deposited as Escrow. PRIX will be automatically returned from Escrow to your Marketplace balance when the VPN offering will be normally closed or manually terminated from the History menu. 

ETH is used to cover GAS costs for blockchain transactions.
