### How to add Port Forwarding on the router:

1. Login to the router admin page 
2. Navigate to the router's port forwarding section \(or Virtual servers\).

Please note, it is recommended to assign on router a static IP address for your computer or device \(by MAC address\) where Privatix Agent is running.

You may also check if UPnP settings are enabled, usually it will work if available.
