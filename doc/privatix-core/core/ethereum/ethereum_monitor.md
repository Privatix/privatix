# Ethereum monitor

[Ethereum monitor](https://github.com/Privatix/dappctrl/tree/master/monitor) get ethereum events \(aka logs\) and creates jobs. from two smart contracts:

* Privatix token contract \(PTC\)
* Privatix service contract \(PSC\)

Each time it queries for events in some blocks range. Received events filtered and corresponding `jobs` produced based on events signatures \(`topic[0]`\) and user role.

Blocks range - is range of ethereum blocks that retrieved in each monitor iteration. Block influenced by:

* eth.event.lastProcessedBlock \(settings\)
* eth.min.confirmations \(settings\)
* eth.event.blocklimit \(settings\)
* eth.event.freshblocks \(settings\)
* BlockMonitor.InitialBlocks \(config\)

Events filtering and job mapping depends on `user role`. E.g. Agent only interested in `LogOfferingCreated`, where his address is found in topic, meaning that his offering succefully included in ethereum block. But Client is interested in all `LogOfferingCreated` events, as that's how he discovers offerings.

Single monitor iteration will produce number of jobs, that will be added to database in single SQL transaction.
