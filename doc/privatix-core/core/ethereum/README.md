# Ethereum

We use [Ethereum smart-contracts](smart_contract.md) for:

* Initial [offering ](../messaging/offering/)discovery
* [Payments](../payments/)

While this functionality can be implemented on alternative blockchain, we found Ethereum as mature and robust enough to handle those tasks. Moreover developers and community standing behind Ethereum project are promising future improvement of scaling and stability.

Privatix core [monitors ](ethereum_monitor.md)Ethereum events and creates [jobs ](../jobs/)to react on blockchain state changes.
