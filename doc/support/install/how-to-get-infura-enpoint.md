# How to get Infura Endpoint

We use [Infura](https://infura.io) as a Blockchain Access Provider. 

Infura has recently limited the number of requests per day. To prevent an application from crashing due to a request limit, we recommend that you use the application through your own Infura account.

As always, your application can be switched to a Geth Node in the same way as described below.

## Step 1. Create Infura Account:

1. Go to [https://infura.io/](https://infura.io/)
2. Register your own account
