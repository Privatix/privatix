# How to detect a trouble cause

The best way to understand what happened is to collect and analyze the logs.

The easiest way to collect logs is [to use an application](via-the-application.md).

It can also be done using [scripts](via-the-scripts.md).

Or do it [manually](manually.md).

If you are an advanced user, you will also find it useful to view transactions \(via [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)\) and data from the database.
